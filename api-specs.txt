Create a Swagger (OpenAPI 3.0) specification file for a RESTful Products API.
Here’s my Product model:
{
  "product_id": 1,
  "name": "Product 1",
  "category": "Books",
  "price": 37.55,
  "stockQuantity": 21,
  "brand": "BrandG",
  "created_at": "2024-12-12 04:21:45",
  "isActive": true
}
Specs:
OpenAPI version 3.0 or later (JSON)
My Products API url will be http://localhost:3000/api/products
GET /products – list all products
Query filters: limit, category
GET /products/{id} – get a product by its product_id
POST /products – create a new product
PUT /products/{id} – update an existing product
PATCH /products/{id} – update partial fields of a product
DELETE /products/{id} – delete a product
Define request and response schemas using the product model
Use appropriate data types and formats (e.g., date-time for created_at, number for price)
Include response examples and possible HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500 etc.)
Tag all endpoints under "Products"
The API should use Authorization header with “ApiKey ****”
How can new consumers request access to the API
